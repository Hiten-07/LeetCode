# LeetCode

**📝 LeetCode Repository**

* This repo is my personal space for solving and sharing LeetCode problems. Think of it as a growing notebook of coding challenges, solutions, and lessons learned along the way.

**🌟 What you’ll find here**

* Solutions to problems across different topics — arrays, dynamic programming, graphs, SQL, and more.

* Code written mainly in Java, with some Python/C++ sprinkled in.

* Clear explanations and comments so it’s easy to follow the thought process.

* Notes on tricky problems, edge cases, and alternative approaches.

**🎯 Why I built this**

* I wanted a place to:

* Track my progress as I practice coding challenges.

* Keep optimized solutions handy for interview prep.

* Share patterns and techniques that can help others too.
